# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

## _Union Types_

Union types allow a variable to be one of multiple types. Think of it as “either/or.”

## Example:

```tsx
let userId: number | string;
userId = 123; // valid
userId = "abc123"; // also valid
```

## _Benefits of Union Types_:

- _Flexibility_: Supports multiple types for a variable.
- _Readability_: Clarifies that a variable can be of different types.
- _Error Prevention_: TypeScript checks assignments to prevent errors.

---

## _Intersection Types_

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. It’s like saying, “must include both.”

## Example:

```tsx
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };

type EmployeePerson = Person & Employee;

let john: EmployeePerson = {
  name: "John",
  employeeId: 123,
};
```

## _Benefits of Intersection Types_:

- _Combining Structures_: Creates complex types by merging properties.
- _Ensures Consistency_: Guarantees that an object includes all properties.
- _Reusable Types_: Easily build new types from existing ones.

---

## When to Use Them

- _Use Union Types_ when a variable could be one of several types.
- _Use Intersection Types_ when a type must include multiple sets of properties.

These types add flexibility and structure to TypeScript, helping you manage data types effectively..
